File Format Identification is the process of figuring out the format of
a sequence of bytes. Operating systems typically do this by file
extension or by embedded MIME information. Forensic applications need to
identify file types by content.

# Tools

## libmagic

- Written in C.
- Rules in /usr/share/file/magic and compiled at runtime.
- Powers the Unix “file” command, but you can also call the library
  directly from a C program.
- <https://sourceforge.net/projects/libmagic>

## Digital Preservation Efforts

PRONOM is a project of the National Archives of the United Kingdom to
develop a registry of file types. A similar project was started by JSTOR
and Harvard as the JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment. Attempts
are now underway to merge these two efforts in the Global Digital Format
Registry and the Universal Digital Format Registry.

The UK National Archives developed the Digital Record Object
Identification (DROID) tool, an "automatic file format identification
tool." This tool is written in Java and can be downloaded from
GitHub.

# Data Sets

If you are working in the field of file format identification, please
consider reporting the results of your algorithm with one of these
publicly available data sets:

- NPS govdocs1m - a corpus of 1 million files that can be redistributed
  without concern of copyright or PII. Download from the [Digital Coprora website](https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/file-corpora/files/)
- The NPS Disk Corpus - a corpus of realistic disk images that contain
  no PII. Information is at: <https://digitalcorpora.org/?s=nps>

# Bibliography

Current research papers on the file format identification problem. Most
of these papers concern themselves with identifying the file format of a few
file sectors, rather than an entire file. **Please note that this
