[ILook Investigator v8](ilook.md) and its disk-imaging
counterpart, [IXimager](iximager.md), offer three proprietary,
authenticated image formats:

* compressed (IDIF)
* non-compressed (IRBF)
* encrypted (IEIF)

Although few technical details are disclosed publicly, IXimager's online
documentation provides some insights: IDIF "includes protective mechanisms to
detect changes from the source image entity to the output form" and supports
"logging of user actions within the confines of that event;" IRBF is similar to
IDIF except that disk images are left uncompressed; IEIF, meanwhile, encrypts
said images.

For compatibility with ILook Investigator v7 and other forensic tools,
IXimager allows for the transformation of each of these formats into raw
format.
